// In the given code, there is not much that can be done to specifically increase the resilience of the Spring Boot application. However, you can consider the following improvements:

// 1. Set appropriate timeouts: The `serverSelectionTimeout` in the `MongoClientOptions` can be adjusted to a suitable value based on your application's requirements. This timeout determines how long the client will wait for a server to be selected when executing operations. Setting an appropriate timeout can help in handling scenarios where servers are slow to respond or unavailable.

// 2. Implement retry logic: You can consider adding retry logic around MongoDB operations to handle transient failures. This can be achieved using libraries like Spring Retry or implementing custom retry mechanisms. Retry logic allows your application to automatically retry failed operations, which can be helpful in recovering from temporary faults.

// 3. Enable connection pooling: Connection pooling can improve the performance and resilience of your MongoDB connections. By default, Spring Data MongoDB uses connection pooling, so you don't need to make any changes in this specific code snippet.

// 4. Configure connection parameters: Apart from timeouts, there are other connection parameters you can configure, such as connection pool size, socket timeout, and socket keep-alive. These parameters can be adjusted based on your application's requirements and the characteristics of your MongoDB deployment.

// Remember that these suggestions may not be applicable in the context of this specific code snippet, but they are general recommendations to increase the resilience of a Spring Boot application that interacts with a MongoDB database.
