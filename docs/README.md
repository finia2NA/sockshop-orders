# Understanding Spring
Sure, here's a brief overview of the basic structure of a Java Spring application:

1. **Application class**: This is the main class of the application that contains the `main` method. It is responsible for starting the application and configuring the Spring context.
- > In our project, this is in OrderApplication.java

2. **Configuration classes**: These classes contain the configuration information for the application. They define beans, set up database connections, configure security, and perform other setup tasks.
- > In our thing, this is in the config folder

- *In the context of a Java Spring application, a bean is a Java object that is managed by the Spring framework's Inversion of Control (IoC) container.  
A bean is simply a Java object that is instantiated, assembled, and managed by the Spring IoC container. The container creates the bean, sets its properties, and manages its lifecycle.  
In a Spring application, beans are defined in configuration files or using annotations. The container creates and manages these beans, making them available for use throughout the application.  
Beans can be thought of as the building blocks of a Spring application. They are used to define the components of the application and provide the functionality that the application needs to operate.*

3. **Controller classes**: These classes handle incoming HTTP requests and return responses. They are responsible for mapping requests to the appropriate methods and returning data to the client.
- > In our thing, this is in the controllers folder

4. **Service classes**: These classes contain the business logic of the application. They handle data processing, perform calculations, and interact with databases or other external systems.
- > In our thing, this is in the services folder

5. **Repository classes**: These classes interact with the database and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on data.
- > In our thing, this is in the repositories folder

6. **Model classes**: These classes define the data structures used by the application. They represent the data entities and are used to transfer data between the different layers of the application.

7. **View templates**: These are the HTML or other templating files that are used to render the user interface of the application.

In addition to these core components, a Java Spring application may also include other features such as security, testing, caching, and logging.
